            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                I am an Educator and Full Stack Developer with a hybrid skill set in Instructional Design and Web Development, dedicated to building powerful, technology-enhanced learning experiences. I specialize in bridging curriculum strategy, pedagogy, and modern web technologies to support academic institutions, vocational programs, and education-driven businesses.

                Using proven frameworks like the ADDIE model, Gagne's Nine Events of Instruction, and Bloom's Taxonomy, I design engaging, outcome-based learning solutions that are grounded in instructional best practices. On the technical side, I develop custom, scalable platforms using React, Node.js, Supabase, MongoDb, PostgreSQL, Python-Django, TailwindCSS, and other technologies—enabling interactivity, personalization, and performance beyond standard LMS capabilities.

                With hands-on experience in platforms like Canvas, Blackboard, Articulate Storyline, and other LMS tools, I create end-to-end learning ecosystems—from instructional content and assessments to user dashboards and analytics—ensuring learners have seamless, accessible, and impactful experiences across devices and environments.
