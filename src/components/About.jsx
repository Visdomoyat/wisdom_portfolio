            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                I am a Full Stack Developer with a background in instructional design, passionate about building scalable, user-focused web applications that power modern learning experiences. With a unique blend of technical expertise and educational insight, I design and develop digital tools that don’t just function well — they teach, engage, and deliver real results.

                My journey started in education, where I learned to design learning experiences that are goal-driven, accessible, and outcomes-oriented. Today, I bring that same mindset into full stack development — combining technologies like React, Node.js, Django, PostgreSQL, and Supabase to build responsive frontends and robust backends that serve learners, educators, and educational businesses alike.

                Whether it is developing curriculum-driven platforms, integrating real-time dashboards, or creating interactive modules and simulations, I focus on building solutions that improve how people learn and interact with content. I also bring experience working in agile, startup-like environments, where rapid iteration, cross-functional collaboration, and user feedback shape everything I build.

                At the core of my work is a belief: technology should make learning more meaningful, not more complicated. I’m always exploring how to bridge pedagogy and programming to create products that empower learners and educators.

                If you're looking for someone who can connect the dots between instructional strategy and modern web development, let's connect.
