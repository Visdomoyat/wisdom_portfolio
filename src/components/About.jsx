            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I am an Educator and Technologist with a hybrid skill set in Instructional Design and Full Stack Development, passionate about creating high-impact, technology-enhanced learning experiences. My work focuses on bridging curriculum strategy with modern web technology to support academic institutions, vocational programs, and educational businesses.

                Grounded in frameworks like the ADDIE model, I design learning experiences that are not only pedagogically sound but also highly engaging and user-friendly. On the development side, I build interactive, scalable learning tools using React, Node.js, python, and other technologies —integrating custom features that go beyond the limitations of out-of-the-box systems.

                I also bring hands-on experience working with widely used Learning Management Systems such as Canvas, Blackboard, and other LMS platforms, where I design and deploy digital content, interactive assessments, and learner tracking systems. My goal is to ensure every solution meets learners where they are—whether in the classroom, on the job, or on the go.
